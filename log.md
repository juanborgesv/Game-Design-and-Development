# Game Design and Development - Log

## Day 0: November 28, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I compared 3 scripts for a Character Controller behavior for the player's character, write down some important details, and got some interesting things that I would like to add to my own Character Controller script. After reading the three scripts I got an interesting and really important question: "When should I read user's input? Update vs FixedUpdate". After reading a post about it in the Unity forum, in short words, I should read user input in the Update method, and then move the character in FixedUpdate, due to possible input loss.

**Thoughts:** Happy to start another log, inspired by my previous log's success about Android Development. I hope to keep working, learning and motivated as good as I did with Android Development.
